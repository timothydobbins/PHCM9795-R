# Introduction {-}

These notes provide an introduction to R and instructions on how to conduct the analyses introduced in Foundations of Biostatistics.

This is the first year that R has been offered as an option. I am keen to receive feedback about the notes and your experience learning R. Please get in touch if anything is unclear, or you have any questions or suggestions.
