# Introduction {.unnumbered}

These notes provide an introduction to R and instructions on how to conduct the analyses introduced in Foundations of Biostatistics.

These notes are currently under development, with sections being added and revised as the course progresses.

This is the first year that R has been offered as an option. I am keen to receive feedback about the notes and your experience learning R. Please [get in touch](mailto:t.dobbins@unsw.edu.au) if anything is unclear, or you have any questions or suggestions.
