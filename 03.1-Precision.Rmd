# Precision: R notes

## Calculating a 95% confidence interval of a mean

### Individual data

To demonstrate the computation of the 95% confidence interval of a mean we have used data from `Example_1.3.rds` which contains the weights of 30 students:

```{r}
library(jmv)

students <- readRDS("data/examples/Example_1.3.rds")

summary(students)
```

The mean and its 95% confidence interval can be obtained many ways in R. One way is to use the `descriptives` function in the `jmv` package. By default, `descriptives` does not provide a confidence interval, but we can request it by specifying `ci=TRUE`:

```{r}
descriptives(data=students, vars=weight, ci=TRUE)
```

### Summarised data

For Worked Example 3.2 where we are given the sample mean, sample standard deviation and sample size. R does not have a built-in function to calculate a confidence interval from summarised data, but we can write our own.

**Note: writing your own functions is beyond the scope of this course. You should copy and paste the code provided to do this.**

```{r}

ci_mean <- function(n, mean, sd, width=0.95, digits=3){
  lcl <- mean - qt(p=(1 - (1-width)/2), df=n-1) * sd/sqrt(n)
  ucl <- mean + qt(p=(1 - (1-width)/2), df=n-1) * sd/sqrt(n)
  
  print(paste0(width*100, "%", " CI: ", format(round(lcl, digits=digits), nsmall = digits),
               " to ", format(round(ucl, digits=digits), nsmall = digits) ))

}
### Copy this section

ci_mean(n=30, mean=70, sd=6, width=0.95)
ci_mean(n=30, mean=70, sd=6, width=0.99)
```
