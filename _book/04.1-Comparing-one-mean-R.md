# Hypothesis testing

## One sample t-test

We will use data from `Example_4.1.dta` to demonstrate how a one-sample t-test is conducted in R.


```r
library(haven)
library(labelled)

bloodpressure <- unlabelled(read_dta("data/examples/Example_4.1.dta"))

summary(bloodpressure)
#>       dbp        
#>  Min.   : 24.00  
#>  1st Qu.: 64.00  
#>  Median : 72.00  
#>  Mean   : 72.41  
#>  3rd Qu.: 80.00  
#>  Max.   :122.00  
#>  NA's   :35
```

To test whether the mean diastolic blood pressure of the population from which the sample was drawn is equal to 71, we can use the t.test command:


```r
t.test(bloodpressure$dbp, mu=71)
#> 
#> 	One Sample t-test
#> 
#> data:  bloodpressure$dbp
#> t = 3.0725, df = 732, p-value = 0.002202
#> alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 71
#> 95 percent confidence interval:
#>  71.50732 73.30305
#> sample estimates:
#> mean of x 
#>  72.40518
```

The output gives a test statistic, degrees of freedom and a P values from the two-sided test. The mean of the sample is provided, as well as the 95% confidence interval.
